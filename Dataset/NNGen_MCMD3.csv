In a long run , I believe doing this control in the queue with ResourceController is better , because ( 1 ) scheduling one at a time can create unnecessary wait time - - - say if one of the configuration needs to run on a slave that ' s blocked , then it ' s better to schedule others first , and ( 2 ) the notion of shared resources spans beyond a single job , so doing that coordination at a job level isn ' t general enough . That said , I think it ' ll be easy enough to maintain data compatibility when this happens , so I ' m committing this change now .",

"JasonLeyba ( on behalf of MichaelTaylor ) : Wrap js eval commands in a CATransaction so that we can explicitly force any UI updates that might occur as a side effect of executing the javascript to finish rendering before we return control back to the HTTP server thread . We actually found some cases where the rendering was finishing before control returned and so the core animation framework would defer committing its implicit transaction until the next iteration of the HTTP server thread ' s run loop . However , because you ' re only allowed to update the UI on the main application thread , committing it on the HTTP server thread would cause the whole application to crash . This feels like it shouldn ' t be necessary but it was the only way we could find to avoid the problem .",
