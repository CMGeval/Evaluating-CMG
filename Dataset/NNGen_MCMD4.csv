"Tween . frameBased allows you to control if a Tween updates based on the physics step ( i . e . frame based ) or the system clock ( time based ) . A frame based tween will use the physics elapsed timer when updating . This means it will retain the same consistent frame rate , regardless of the speed of the device . The duration value given should be given in frames . If the Tween uses a time based update ( which is the default ) then the duration is given in milliseconds . In this situation a 2000ms tween will last exactly 2 seconds , regardless of the device and how many visual updates the tween has actually been through .","TweenData . repeatTotal is a new property that keeps track of the total number of times the Tween should repeat . If TweenData . start is called , as a result of the Tween repeatCount being > 0 then the child tween resets its total before re - starting ."

"ArcadePhysics . overlap has been updated so that the Body . overlapX / Y properties are set to the amount the two bodies overlapped by . Previously they were zero and only populated during the separation phase , but now the data is available for just overlap checks as well . You can then use these values in your ovrelap callback as required - note that they are changed for every check , so a Sprite overlap tested against 10 other sprites will have the overlapX / Y values updated 10 times in a single collision pass , so you can only safely use the values in the callback ( )",ArcadePhysics .
